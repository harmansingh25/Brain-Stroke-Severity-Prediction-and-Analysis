# Introduction
Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel that carries oxygen and nutrients to the brain is either blocked by a clot or ruptures. According to the WHO, stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death worldwide. Globally, 3% of the population are affected by subarachnoid hemorrhage, 10% with intracerebral hemorrhage, and the majority of 87% with ischemic stroke. 80% of the time these strokes can be prevented, so putting in place proper education on the signs of stroke is very important. The existing research is limited in predicting risk factors pertained to various types of strokes. This research work proposes an early prediction of stroke diseases by using different machine learning approaches with the occurrence of hypertension, body mass index level, average glucose level, smoking status, previous stroke and age. Machine Learning techniques including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees,Naive Bayesk, etc. are used to predict the severity of future stroke occurrence on a scale of 0 to 3.
